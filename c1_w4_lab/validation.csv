__label__0 "while i loved the material color and concept of the dress it was much too large and sack-like . i 'm 5 ' 2 and 108 lbs pear-shaped . i purchased the regular xs given stated length in the description . while the length was just right it was just much too large throughout . i 'm not sure that even an xxs will help so sadly this will be going back ."
__label__1 "i wear this vest a lot for it is really cozy and goes with a lot of different types of outfits ! it 's is versatile and figure flattering . i only buy timeless pieces that i know wo n't go out of style and this vest fits the bill !"
__label__-1 "the buttons on the back are very tedious . you will need someone to help you . if you get past that hurdle then you have the look of a little girl in a smock . way too big . like a nightgown . nice quality but not practical ."
__label__0 "i thought these would be nice and they are but then i started thinking that the bejewels will eventually be out of style and these ca n't be as much of a classic ... also the jewels make the jeans feel heavier . fit is like most boyfriend/girlfriend jeans slightly loose ( not as much on me due to muscles ) and length on petite was close to what is shown here ( typical for me that it is still a bit longer as not only am i short but i have short legs for my shortness ! ) so if you want that styl"

__label__1 "i think this t-shirt is so cute . simple but cute . i originally ordered this in medium . i washed and wore it once but realized it was really too big . my normal size is small so i reordered it . it is slightly shear for my taste so i do wear a cami underneath . i plan to wear this to my 2 year old 's gymnastics class . it is little yoga people but close enough ! i normally hang dry all my clothes from retailer as they can be quite delicate but the first one i washed did wash well ."
__label__-1 "this was exactly the item i was looking for . simple black stylish . unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off . the upper arms chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering ."
__label__0 "this dress is nice colors and well made but it 's just not the style for me . it almost fits frumpy . i 'm not sure that a belt would even make it look good . also being 5 ' 8 it is shorter than i 'd wear . i like at least touching top of the foot for a maxi ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to recommend this sweater but honestly ca n't now . i was attracted to the softness simplicity and sale price but its longevity ruined it . wrinkles pills and loses shape quickly . if you still want to get it consider your shoulders and how knits like this fit on you . this sweater runs tts to large depending on your shoulders and bust size . the styling is excellent -- very versatile . but the yarn is too delicate and fussy ."

__label__1 "i ordered the cream . the fabric is unique . similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality . you definitely need a cami or tank underneath . its form fitting without being too snug . i like to wear it with distressed jeans front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle ( my trouble spot ) with chunky accessories belt necklace and a block heel . it 's a little pricey but decided worth it ."

__label__-1 "the back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird . the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy . i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front . it fits true to size ."

__label__0 "this is not worth $ 128 . it looks cute on but .... there is no support in the bust area . just a slight tuck in the fabric -it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i can not recommend and will be returning . i 'll look for something else . i have n't bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality has n't slipped - i will look for another option ."
__label__-1 "hahaha .. this dress is hilarious ! it looks nothing like the image ! i am usually a 0/xs and 4 was the smallest size available so i ordered it . when i opened it it felt like 10 lbs of fabric . i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress . once i looked in the mirror i almost fell over laughing . the rest of the dress is huge . i do n't believe this dress would be flattering on anyone ."

__label__0 "yes this top is not of the best quality but i bought it on sale with an additional 25 % off . it has a very cute design on the back and will be cute on while running errands on a hot day . it 's true to size : i 'm 5 ' 6 150 lbs and m fit well ."
__label__-1 "i love the design of this top however it 's quality is lackluster . the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering ( at least on me ) if it had a few more inches . also it 's pretty sheer so figuring out under garments is a dilemma . i will still wear it because i love it . looks great with a denim vest over it !"

__label__0 "i was really pulling for this dress to work because it 's beautiful however the neckline is cut so extremely low that i had to return . it 's much higher on the model than in real life . the petite length was still far too long so additional hemming required otherwise fit was true to size ( 5 ' 3 130 lbs size 6p )"

__label__1 "this is definitely my go to top for work weekends or night out with the husband . i 've worn it with skinny jeans black tights and skirts . it goes with just about anything . easy to accessorize with a simple long chain necklace or a statement piece . i think the gray combo was a bit more flattering than the green combo ."
__label__-1 "beautiful color design and fit . but i could n't wait to get it off . i do n't have sensitive skin and do n't recall ever putting a jacket on that felt like steel wool ."
__label__1 "this is a really nice fitting sweater knit skirt . the knit is soft and comfortable heavy enough to smooth out some bumps but definitely shows your curves . i got medium and it 's a little snug at the waist ( i 'm about 29-1/2 ) but not so much to return it and it fits the rest of me great . the only thing i wish was that they 'd made the slip full length it only goes about mid-thigh and sometimes when i get up the slip stays up while the skirt falls right but not a big negative ."
__label__-1 "this dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on . even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless . there is no waist as pictured . the hi-low hem loose fit and wavy waist seam ( see in the third close-up picture ) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it 's really too bad it 's such a pretty combination of patterns ."
__label__1 "although i find $ 150 a little pricey for a sleeveless sweater buy it . i bought a size medium which fits me exactly . it is an off-white which is what i wanted . i will be wearing it with a sweater skirt for the sweater dress look . it is comfortable and versatile-also with a jacket ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress but i could n't . it ran large and heavy . rather than a sleek cocktail dress it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on . there was one upside : the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture ."
__label__1 "this jacket looked so good and felt so comfortable on- i almost did n't send back the first one that arrived with a little bit of damage at the bottom of the inner zippered sweatshirt but i did exchange it and am just as happy with the fit and feel of the second one . it hangs well no matter how you fasten the front or leave it open . great looking casual but stylish and neat . a good grey and a good blue ."
__label__-1 "if you have anything larger than an a cup this shirt will likely not fit right . it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest . it literally runs right through the center of the breasts . what were they thinking ? if it had been three inches higher or lower it would have been perfect . for reference i 'm approximately 105lb and have a dd cup ."

__label__1 "a really beautiful well made dress . runs extremely big though ! i 'm not petite by any means and ordered a large but i 'm positively swimming in it . an oversized look works for this particular dress but i think it 's supposed to be more fitted so i would recommend sizing down from what you might normally expect for a piece of this style ."

__label__0 "i loved these on the hanger when i saw them in the store . i liked the fabric but found the full cut of the pant added a ton of bulk to my hips ( and i do n't have big hips ) . i also thought the waist was a bit snug while the rest of the pant ran tts . they went back ."

__label__0 "i think this dress is very pretty and i like that it 's made of silk . i also like the way it fits since it skims over my figure flaws without being too poufy . what i do n't like is the sloppiness of how the print was stitched on my dress . the print frame is offset and details are cut off in both the front and back ( you can see similar in the model shot from behind ) . for the price i was expecting a little more quality control . i also do not care for the lining . i do not think the off white is"
__label__0 "it feels soft and like a good quality . however it really does run large and long . i was looking for a loose tank but this one was almost a tunic on my short height and even with a cardigan to give it a shape did n't work out . i also thought it would shrink in the dryer but it did n't . also wrinkles easily ."
__label__-1 "i was excited to get this romper but it just did n't work . i 'm petite with a large bust and the blousy design of the top portion just hung like a bag on me . returned ."
__label__1 "this dress was exactly what i was looking for- a rich luxurious fabric a deep neckline and a tightly cinched waist . i have a full bust and while the snug waistband was a negative for some reviewers for me it is a little miracle . this dress fit like a glove and was flattering in my usual size . thank you !"
__label__0 "this design looks really sharp on the image but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi . the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap . since the fabric was pretty soft with a gray jersey lining it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer . i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b i felt like i was busting out of a size 8 and i am a 34d ."
__label__0 "i bought the white tee . while the print is nice the size is a bit too large with the xs looking relatively baggy ( i am around medium weight and very short ) ."
__label__1 "i immediately loved the rich royal blue color of this sweater with its pretty flower nice fabric and medium weight . nice warm sweater.i have an retailer skirt just like the photo great outfit . i am happy i ordered it but hope it shrinks after washing.the small is very big and boxy sleeves long . i am 5 ' 6 medium build . small usually fits me well . i recommend downsizing or you will probably take this back ."
__label__1 "this is a great summer maxi dress . i am 5 ' 4 120lbs about a size 4 in dresses 32dd . i got this in an extra small . i was really happy that on someone my height it 's just a few inches above my ankle so did not shorten me at all . the straps were a good length and the waist hit at the right spot . i do n't think the waist detail not going all the way around is a big deal there are the little snaps in the straps for your bra and skirt is lined . the turquoise color is really pretty and the fabric"
__label__0 "let me start this review by saying 75 % of my clothing is from retailer and i love them . my husband bought this sweater for me recently and it 's gorgeous but when i tried it on one sleeve was longer than the other . i went to the store and tried on several sweaters even in different colors and had the same issue . sometimes is was extreme sometimes is was n't as noticeable . it was noticeable to me however as i am 6 ' and sleeve length is super obvious when its too short . love the sweater as it wa"
__label__0 "i do n't have a lot of pink or lavender in my wardrobe but any time i do try a shade like this on i always think it compliments my skin tone and hair color . i generally wear a mauve-ish or coppery eye shadow and the color of this shirt looks beautiful against that makeup too . unfortunately i just do n't find the shape of the top to be flattering . it 's really long so the way the model has it partially tucked looks best but i 'm not really thin like her and i have a larger chest ... it just does n't"
__label__1 "from the online pics i would never think to try this on but i was looking for a shirtdress with pockets so glad i did ! i purchased in green and navy ... i love the neck line when buttoned up almost military jacket'ish and i like the idea of wearing over jeans and a shirt and leaving unbuttoned almost like a light layer or jacket . super soft material ... i purchased a size 6 and i am 5 ' 9 and 140 lbs ."
__label__1 "this is just a fantastic dress ! i bought it in my usual m in the blue and it fits like a glove . i love the varying lengths and the adorable sleeves and the substantial knit which feels amazing on the body without revealing any bumps and lumps : ) i took the regular length and found it perfect . the front hits about two inches above my knee and the rest hits a bit lower . i 'm only 51 but i prefer dresses that hit closer to my knee than mini so the regular was perfect for me definitely a keeper !"
__label__0 "i love the look of this sweater and was so happy with how it looked and felt when i first tried it on but within a day of wear i noticed significant pilling which made it appear much older / worn ."
__label__-1 "these are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom ! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight but these fit perfectly ( even on the looser side ) and ripped effortlessly . pretty embarrassing given the price ! bringing these back ! for reference ( if you decide to try your luck ) i am 5 ' 7 128 # and my normal size s was perfect ."
__label__0 "i 'm surprised this worked for so many people . for me this dress fit terribly . however the fabric was very thick and the dress felt very well made . i am 5 ' 3 and about 117 with a really short torso and this dress just showed every bump and lump i have . i think the bodice was just too long for me . the neckline was also too low . on someone taller or maybe with a longer torso i could see this dress being really lovely ."
__label__-1 "i 've been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi feels like a perfect summer staple ... but sadly this was not it . quality is n't great which is surprise on a $ 168 price tag . top of dress is lined but cheaply so it 's somewhat see through . the dress was returned ."
__label__1 "this is a fun sparkly top that was great over the holidays with a sparkly long-sleeved top underneath and will be fun in the summer too . i got a size small since my regular size extra-small was sold out and it was still really cute . great cut and design . as others have mentioned the quality could be slightly better but it 's a good deal if you get it on sale ."
__label__-1 "i have to return this top . the armholes are huge . the material is on the thin side and not what i expected . i ca n't size down . i got an xxs . maybe if i had been able to order a petite it would have fit better . i ordered the red and i liked the color ."
__label__0 "i do n't know if i was sent a petite by mistake but this is not 39 inches long . i realize it says swing dress but i thought if the length was accurate and the fabric heavy enough the weight would make it flattering on me . as it was in reality -- short and light-weight fabric -- it poofed out in an unattractive way . too bad as the print is lovely ."

__label__0 "i ordered this in a medium and although the details/design of the shirt were cute the swing did not work for me this time around . i typically like looser fitting tops but with this shirt i felt like there was just too much material and made me feel like i was wearing a tent ."
__label__0 "i could n't believe there were n't more reviews complaining about the arm size ... then i found them ! yes this is a cute shirt if you have toothpicks for arms ! so true ! the shirt is adorable ... a bit guazy ( so not going to be super warm for fall/winter ... but i live in cali so that 's not an issue ) . but my arms are n't even big and this shirt is so snug around my arms ! unfortunately it 's going back : ("
__label__0 "this is absolutely huge . it felt like it was at least 2 sizes too big - the empire waist was n't even semi- fit . 36d chest and size small was like a tent . however the embroidery was beautiful"
__label__1 "i love this top and it 's so pretty in person . knew it would be full but was hoping it would n't be too big . it 's perfect and looks good with jeans ."
__label__1 "this dress has a really lovely design and is very very comfortable . it is not quite as flattering as i had hoped and does n't have quite as defined a shape as i expected . still it 's cute and i 'm happy to have it !"
__label__1 "in love with this blouse i first got in ivory went back and got in black you can dress casual or up ."
__label__1 "i was looking for a romper for a long time which i do n't need to care whether to wear bras after taking shower and relax . because of its design with a line on the top no worries for a relaxed romper . the texture was not as silky as i wished but you will like this if you want a light on weight ."
__label__0 "honestly the sweater is really beautiful ... i usually buy a small in retailer tops and this seemed to run on the smaller side . it & # 39 ; s pretty short but the issue i have is that the sleeves are much shorter in person than on the models in the pictures . it looks like i & # 39 ; m wearing a 3/4 sleeve shirt . still deciding if i & # 39 ; m going to keep it because it is really a lovely top ."
__label__-1 "i 'm 5 ' 5 and 140 lbs - hardly super-tiny and the xs was swimming on me . the shoulders are oddly large and this beautiful sweater/jacket just hangs off the body . believe it when they say oversized styling - unfortunately will have to return ."
__label__0 "i so wanted this blouse to work . the lacework is beautiful and it is a substantial and well made top . the neck fits well which is not a given for this style top and i really like the 3/4 length sleeves . but the top billows out like a tent on me in all directions and it was an awkward length on me ( not quite hip length not quite tunic ) . wish this were cut a little straighter and longer . i 'm 5 ' 4 120 lbs and tried a size s ."
__label__-1 "so these look so good online - i love flare and the button detail . however on me they were very long ( which i knew ) but too thigh-hugging for my taste and the buttons looked cheap ( i ordered the tan color ) . thus back they went . for reference i am 5 ' 5 and 125 # and ordered the 6 ."
__label__1 "i feel really cool wearing this skirt : - ) a nice alternative to the jeans that are my standard uniform . loooks great with short boots . i 'm wearing it as i write this review -- and was wearing it all day . awesome skirt !"
__label__1 "bought these pants for a long trip through south east asia . tried them on at home and instantly fell in love with the relaxed yet styled look . will be incredibly versatile on my trip which i need as i am bringing only ~15 pounds of luggage including the bag . they seem breathable and are light weight . super flattering as they are slightly slimming and do n't bunch up at the waste . i got the greenish color ."
__label__0 "this is a thick sweater . it is pretty but has a short length ."
__label__-1 "the pants are pretty and run true to size but the fabric is bathing suit like very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat . i would n't recommend for anything but waking ."
__label__1 "this top is sooo cute . it does not look like pajamas as one person said it looks like a top . it 's a bit on the boxy style so anything you want to hide below is well covered . has a nice length to it . is not just for lounging . paired it with a black pencil skirt and it looked great . i ordered the xl ( i am a 40d for reference ) and it hung very nicely . its extremely soft and very comfy . i only wish they had more colors ."
__label__1 "i ordered this skirt online in a size 8 but returned for a 10 so it could sit a bit lower . the fabric is so beautiful and a bit heavier so it can be worn all year long . so glad i made this purchase ."
__label__-1 "i was really excited to get this dress and to my dismay when i pulled it out of the package i could tell i would be disappointed . i tried it on and i was correct .... it looked like i was wearing a huge tent . i returned it ."
__label__1 "really cute and very comfortable . material is thin and sheer . i wear tanks under things anyway but especially in pink you would need to . but love the style ."
__label__-1 "this top is has an awkward neckline does n't lay like the photo ( as mentioned by another reviewer . ) see threw and of poor quality . the fit is very baggy and unflattering . and material is very thin . it also runs very large ! ! the color is pretty but that is it : ("
__label__1 "i was looking for a lightweight top to wear with black linen trousers to a party i was not sure of this top seeing it on a slender model ( i am a more typical 50 year old mom body ) and i have never worn a peplum style . i put it on for my husband and approved so i wore it . i received many compliments - a few from good friends who congratulated me for going out of my 'comfort zone ' with the style !"
__label__1 "this one is perfect for the taller ladies ( or those looking for a longer fit ) . i was a little discouraged by a few short-fitting tops recently and this one finally works for me ( at 5 ' 7 with a long torso ) . awesome quality not overly delicate and beautiful detail ."
__label__-1 "fits and lots nothing like picture . very wide like a tent dress !"
__label__1 "wonderful dress ! thank you for making a fun and sassy dress that actually fits me ! normally this sort of dress would n't fit with it failing me in the bust but it fit quite well . in most cases i would end-up in a 12 petite to accommodate my bust but with it then too large in the shoulders or the dress would have run so small i would n't have been able to button it in most places . i was pleasantly surprised not only with the fit but the quality as well . as described by other reviewers it"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress . i am not comfortable wearing dresses much above the knee and i liked the length and the way this looks on the model . however in person this dress is cut like a sack . it is not tapered at all in the waist and there is just too much fabric when you cinch the belt at least on me . it was oddly shapeless even with the belt . it seemed a size too large . i ordered the xxsp . for reference i am 5 ' 1 and 107 lbs . i ordered the neutral dress and i really like the fabric and c"
__label__0 "these are really nice pants - color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within 30 minutes they looked 2 sizes too big - they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough . i would go down a size for sure . the cons are n't unsolvable so try them out !"
__label__-1 "well made dress but too much fabric for my taste . it lays a little heavy on the body & does not give a slimming affect . the colors are vibrant & pretty but the dress is too long as well . as other reviewers have said the front is too low cut but turn it around and it looks & feels better . did n't work for me sadly i 'll be returning it ."
__label__0 "this is a heavy dress - it 's surprising when you lift up the hanger how much it weighs because it looks like a light sundress . and on my frame which is pretty thin it hits my shoulders and then my hips and just falls ... so the heft of it means there 's no waistline ... it 's an odd fit . the color is gorgeous but the lack of shape made this a no ."
__label__0 "i am 5 ' 4 1/2 125 lbs . and ordered a m in this . i 'm usually between a s and m. it was too big and did n't have any shape to it . i do n't think a s would fit much better . also i ordered the pink but it was really a coral . if my local store had a s i would probably try it on in a different color but they do n't . i 'll have to return this . it looks so cute online ."
__label__-1 "i love the dress as shown in the photo . thankfully i had a chance to see the dress in the store . it is sheer . can see thru it . can not wear this to work ."
__label__1 "absolutely love everything about this dress . unlike many other dresses i 've ordered from retailer it fits me in the chest ( 34c ) . it 's very flattering . love the lace up front and the fabric is like a soft lined linen . ca n't wait to wear it . i got the s regular . if i was any bigger in the chest or through the ribs tho it would be too small . i almost ordered the medium and was certain i would end up needing a bigger size but the small turned out just right . like it was made for me"
__label__0 "first comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small which is not in line with most retailer pieces . i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close on top of being busty . the material is thin and mildly see thru but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top . i decided to keep it ."
__label__-1 "i am sooooooo massively disappointed in this purchase . i thought i had found the perfect pant in this style . both more comfortable and more flattering than similar styles in the store . i wanted to wear them every day ; received lots of compliments ; felt that you could dress up or down ; etc . this is where i have to admit that i wore them several times straight from the store before washing . on the second wear i noticed threads coming out on the seams but just on one side of one leg . this was irr"
__label__-1 "poor quality material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured ."
__label__1 "great soft basic . low scoop neck makes this tank flirty while the thicker strap keeps it modest . i absolutely love this top easily dress up and down !"
__label__0 "i loved this when i got it . it has such a flattering fit ! slightly loose in the body but not flowy . nice weight of fabric . comfortable fabric . perfect scoop neck that does n't show too much cleavage . but i washed it once on delicate and line dried ( which i do with most of my shirts ) and it came out riddled in holes ."
__label__-1 "the review above titled so disappointed could n't have said it any better . the dresses from last year are perfect . i probably wear them at least once a week . i was so excited to see this vibrant blue color and fully expected the same quality as last year . i 'm generally an xs or s in dresses ( however i have xxs from last year 's version ) and the xs in this one is lifeless . it 's heavy hot does n't have the same nice shape as last year . i may cut out the integrated lining just to lighten the dres"
__label__-1 "beautiful fabric ! unfortunately i had to return it . after just one wear it had pills all over the side . fabric is too delicate . sad to return !"
__label__-1 "while you ca n't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item these photos are way off . instead of the warm charcoal i see online the pants are more of a dusty blue . the material has very little stretch and i could n't get into the size 24s . the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist . for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity ."
__label__-1 "these run very small ! ! they are also short almost like a crop pant . the fit was so weird that i wo n't even exchange for a bigger size ."
__label__0 "great color and quality but very boxy . even with the drawstring there is no shape going on here ."
__label__1 "this robe is warm soft and i like how long it is ! it 's perfect length . my favorite thing to wear around the house !"
__label__-1 "this sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it . and without a chunky statement necklace it looks like your grandmothers apron . there just is n't any style to it - has to go back ."
__label__-1 "this top was originally way overpriced . so i ordered it on sale for half price . still overpriced . it arrived yesterday and frankly i am disappointed . the quality is not great . it is like a jersey type material . does n't look like the photograph at all . i like the color but frankly that 's about it ."
__label__0 "i agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big . for my body straight up and down i ordered 2 sizes down but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store . the jeans i received were lighter not blue and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering . i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair but for me because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture ."
__label__0 "i bought the s ; came with a tag saying sz 8. it is in fact more like a size 2 if not 0. the bust is probably a 34 a or b or 32a or b - the cups fit me relatively well but the rest was so tight that i could barely manage to put put it in . i ca n't imagine wrestling with this bathing suit each time i want to wear it so i will return it . the fabric design is as spectacular as it looks though ... very good quality ."
__label__1 "i actually saw angela from the tv show bones wearing this dress and decided i loved it so much i had to find out where it was from ! after ordering this dress i could n't be happier i love it ! it is a very flattering shape and a thick material so it falls nicely ."
__label__1 "these cords are a great skinny fit . they seem true to size for me and look great on . only issue i would have is the color says navy but they are more of a deep purple-ish color . i had to recheck my order because they definitely are n't navy .... but i 'm keeping them because the fit is awesome ."
__label__0 "this style is very pretty and flattering . i love the flow of the material and the open shoulders are nice for the design"
__label__1 "love these . wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots . nice subtle print . i think they run about 1 size small . i 'm normally a size 0/25 . the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled . size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough . incidentally i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too . love love"
__label__1 "i 've only worn the sweater a handful of times but i 'm already in love with how soft and comfortable it is . it 's a bit on the baggier side but that does n't stop it from looking great . i 've gotten complements on it every time i 've worn it . i would highly recommend it to people who do n't like the typical scratchy/itchy textiles ."
__label__0 "i should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering . although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo it 's very scratchy and uncomfortable . i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider which would have been more flattering on me . i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this . i 'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they do n't mind the texture . i 'm sending it back ."
__label__1 "this dress is so soft and cozy and pretty . love the shine and interesting sheen whenever you move . very comfortable and looks great with a variety of layers . i want to buy more colors but right now i just have the mauve . ordered size m and i 'm 38-27-35 # 135 ."
__label__0 "i ca n't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted ( if so it 's too big but the length works ) or if it 's supposed to sit on my hips ( fits well but too long ) . but the material is really comfortable and the design is different in a good way ."
__label__0 "there is simply a ton of fabric on this tee . i am a size 8 on top with a fairly thin upper body but still an 8. at retailer i often order small for swingy tees medium for more slim-cut . this tee in the small was huge . the shoulders fit well but the body was so big and was a weirdly long length . just odd especially for $ 78 ..."
__label__0 "this dress is adorable . the color is on the red orange side and is nice for the summer . the cotton is also nice and light . however the bust is cut short and the skirt is unforgiving to girls with hips . if you have b/c cup or less and do not have an hour glass figure then this dress may be for you ."
__label__-1 "the color of this dress is gorgeous and i really wanted to love it . but it was awful . i am 5 ' 9 '' and the length was fine . the problem is the lack of shape which made me look 50 - 100 lbs heavier than i am . it would make a great maternity dress since that is what it already looks like ."
__label__1 "i have these in 3 colors and i always wear a 27 in pilcro . i could probably size down but i like them a little loose . they are great to have in the spring and summer . they are very soft and very comfy ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this shirt . the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out . the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through .. sadly i will be returning ."
__label__-1 "the colors are so much brighter than pictured . although the sweater is very comfortable i did not like the color combination . i will be returning it ."
__label__0 "i really liked these jeans initially but by the end of the day the waist is really baggy . the fabric stretches with wear and takes a wash to get back to its original shape ."
__label__1 "bought pink and cream colors on sale . arm holes on my usual size medium were large so bought smalls and like them a lot . i 'm 5 ' 9 and longer front and back worked well . fabric weave nice weight and good for summer or cooler with sweater or jacket over it ."
__label__-1 "the print does n't necessarily works for everybody ."
__label__1 "this dress is even more gorgeous in person ! i had seen in the spring catalog but liked it even more when i spotted it at my local store . i have been searching for the perfect ivory crochet or lace dress each summer for the past few years . i think i have finally found the one ' ! i should note i am 5 ' 9 and this dress goes all the way to my knees . it may swallow someone on the shorter side ."

__label__0 "tried on this maxi dress recently hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin . so sad : ( . unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much . a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress - it is gorgeous on the model but unfortunately for me it did n't fit right . i 'm petite and ordered the xxs petite . it was snug in the upper body and looked like i was wearing a baby-doll dress . the material is high quality and i love the burnt red color . it just did n't fit right . definitely looks great on the model but hung funny on me . i can see why it was highly rated gorgeous dress - just not on me ."

__label__0 "this top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price . it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it . also the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt . still the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans ."

__label__1 "i love the contemporary style of this piece but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me ( 5 ' 1 ) . but if you do n't mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms it might work for you . the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces ."
__label__0 "the top is made well and has a strap holder to keep your bra hidden which is always a nice feature . however the amount of fabric made it unflattering on me . the overall design is fun and i probably would have purchased if it had been more fitted and flattering . i have a medium on in the photo my measurements are 38-30-40 ."
__label__-1 "i loved the criss cross part of this tank . however it looked so frumpy on . the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent . i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on . i returned it . the material felt nice too ."

__label__-1 "after reading the previous review i was pretty confident in ordering this dress . it arrived in the mail today and i was so disappointed . first of all it 's huge . the medium was way too big on me and i 'm never a small at retailer ! ( i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer . ) second the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo and the fabric felt cheap . finally it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that did n't fit right ."
__label__0 "i love the colors in this top but i returned it for a few reasons . the material is extremely fragile ; with small kids i knew this would be snagged all over after my first day of wearing it . my other issue was that it came to just below my belt on me . i was under the impression from the photo that it was more of a tunic style top . i 'm 5 ' 6 and it just did n't look that way on me ."
__label__1 "i adore this top ! the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt that 's been worn for years . it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round . even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders it still works and looks just fine . i 'm broad in the shoulders and we 'll endowed but the large was perfect ."
__label__0 "the pink version of this top finally arrived -- nearly 2 months after ordering . the expected delivery date kept slipping . the color is not as shown online . online it looks like a light pink . the actual top was more of taupe color . it 's a basic tee with pretty ruffling at the bottom . not enough to keep ."
__label__0 "this sweater is beautiful and well made but i found the cut strange and unflattering . i ordered it in my usual size small and it was too big in the shoulders and arms with a lot of fabric bunching up under my arms . but it just fit me in the chest and would be too tight if i sized down . this might work for you if you are not busty and order a size down from your usual ."
__label__0 "this dress is most definitely not a maxi ! barely goes below the knees . also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice . there are no folds which were an added plus on picture . waist is higher not at natural waist . very pretty silk though and still cute . just not as pictured ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this kimono ... it is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabric ... not a soft touch and because it runs small . i bought the m/l and usually wear a 12/14 but i could n't bring the kimono together in the front ( for a belting option ) ."
__label__0 "the dress is too big . i got size 4 after checking the measurements chart ( for reference : 5 ' 7 125 lb ) . it is too wide not as fitted as in the picture . the cut is too deep ( might work better for a bustier lady but looks pathetic on me ) . the pattern is too bright much brighter that in the picture ( i got red pattern ) . it 's not that the photos represent the colors inaccurately it 's just ... the colors are much more vibrant in real life . the material is heavier than i expected ."
__label__1 "this top fits exactly like the last photo which was my hope . it is not as slim as the other images . it 's a swing top and the arm holes are perfect size and the mock turtleneck is not too high . the fabric is thick so will be perfect transitioning from summer to fall ."

__label__1 "i 've been looking for a staple long-sleeve tee for a while now and i think i 've found it ! i bought this tee in my usual retailer size of medium and the fit is perfect . the material is soft the cut highlights an hourglass figure without clinging in the wrong places . the sleeves are long enough which can sometimes be a problem for me . the length is perfect to wear with leggings without being too long . i 'll be back for more colors !"
__label__0 "i ordered this sweater in black and thought it was a pretty design and something different in a cardigan . when i tried it on it was an odd fit and very boxy and unflattering . i wanted to like it and keep it but i knew i would not wear it so unfortunately it went back ."
__label__-1 "this bunches up too much and the fabric is even more see through than i expected ( so even with a tank top under it it 's not a good look for work ) . even unbuttoned at the top i could barely get this over my head ! this one is going back ."
__label__0 "i practically live in lounge pants and i like the unique style of this wide-leg version . i 'm generally a 6/28 in pants and ordered the small which fit well if a bit big . the overall fit is great - slim at the hip with a nice wide waistband and flatteringly-placed dropped pockets . the pants really slim my hips and provide a nice silhouette with the wide legs . the fabric is soft and flows and i did not experience any sheerness . as for color - i would call these a deep cool brown definitely not"
__label__-1 "i was so excited when i ordered this i love comfy clothing this looked perfect ! when i received it there was a weird smell with the top . convinced that this could be from storage or something i washed it . the smell did not go away . i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear ! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it not able to return it . the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell . now i am 'stuck ' ! !"
__label__0 "i had ordered another retailer suit awhile back in an xl because my usual lg was not available and lets say i was swimming in the xl much to big . so when this suit came up for sale i snatched it up in lg . when i compare the two the lg is over 4inches smaller than the xl seems like quite a big jump in the sizing . the suit fits in the body quite well however it 's a bit snug in the side bust area . strangely the suit has boning on the side of the bust and also the silicone grip on the top edge"

__label__-1 "i am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes ! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips ... but for those of us with curves ( i 'm a size 12 hourglass ) these are very unflattering . they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds just around the hips ! so bummed because they look so cute on the model ."
__label__-1 "this dress looked adorable online but unfortunately it 's not flattering at all and it 's completely see-through . completely . the material is so thin that i ca n't imagine it would hold up very well over time . this one is definitely going back ."

__label__0 "the button detail on the sides is a unique design detail . i had fun playing with different looks that came with unbuttoning and buttoning the sides . but i decided against purchasing this top it appeared shapeless on me . i have a curvier/athletic figure and a straight up and down cut is not flattering on my figure ."
__label__0 "the dress had great potential but the top sagged and made the dress look unflattering on me . unfortunately i had to return it . the length was great and the back and sides of the dress were nicely tailored and flattering . perhaps this would fit someone else better - i have a 34b/34c bust and it did n't work for me ."
__label__-1 "i was expecting a lot more but this was disappointing . the material is thin and the quality is n't great . it also hung loose just too loose as it runs very very large i returned it"
__label__-1 "this top seemed so unique online but in person it was really nothing like the pics . super full shorter cut . the quality was n't what i thought it would be . i will gladly pay for nice quality fabric and unique prints anyday ... but this was n't any of those things .."
__label__-1 "do n't be fooled by the image ; unless you have a c/d chest this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle -- exactly where you want it least ! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality . back it goes !"
__label__-1 "i love the colors . however $ 200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric no lining what so ever . the fabric is very thin . you will need a slip . looks just like a cover-up . going back ."

__label__0 "as other reviewers have noted the fit of this tee is very boxy . it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans but otherwise is unflattering . also the color is described as black but mine looks like a navy blue in person . i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult but if able to i would have returned it ."
__label__1 "love these ! loose and comfy everywhere . delighted to have found a 32 and delighted that they are roomy even at the waist . i exchanged another pair of pilcro 's and was afraid of a shipping/pricing conflict but as usual retailer customer service was excellent . earlier sale price was honored easy returns in the orignal shipping bag .. retailer design fashion and company attitude excels !"
__label__1 "this does run a little large but it 's light and flattering for me . the material is a very light/thin chambray but it 's also lined ."
__label__0 "ugh . i was so excited to get this dress and for 30 % off . this dress is adorable . unfortunately the top part is super tight around my girls . otherwise the fit was perfect . very disappointed in the top of this dress ."
__label__-1 "i agree with the other reviewer about the great colors but when i took this off the rack to try one you can see through both layers of fabric . i thought insulting quality for the price . i imagine the holes would start after one wearing ."
__label__0 "i tried this in an xxsp . i am normally an ssxp or xsp . it fit me well everywhere except in the crotch where i was given a slight wedgie . not the look i was going for . if i sized up the rest of the jumpsuit would be too large on my frame . also i don ? t feel the quality matched the price point . the one i received had a lot of loose stings already and it was unopened previously . that being said it is a beautiful color and on the right body the style would work well . it just wasn ? t for me ."
__label__1 "i wore this with a velvet moss-colored skirt ( also sold at retailer ) that hits above knee and received so many compliments . the neckline and sleeves are gorgeous . i like my sweaters comfy so i ordered a medium and love it . not quite cropped but it does hit a bit higher on the waist . sleeves hit above wrist as well ."
__label__1 "i was in love with this top from the moment i put it on . it is of high quality with layers to ensure the top is n't sheer . the embroidery is so pretty and the top looks way less grandma in person . i ordered the petite xxs and it fits perfectly . i really appreciate that the underarm holes are just the right size and do n't show off any of my bra which sometimes happens with sleeveless tops . i can wear it with jeans and boots or with a pencil skirt and heels and it looks great with both outfits . o"

__label__-1 "i saw this top online and ordered immediately ! i loved the color lace and unique details . sadly it just arrived and it is a disaster ! the lace is stiff and does n't lay softly and is very rough against your skin . the style ( and i like shorter style tops ) is extremely boxy and the sleeves protrude outwards in a funny way . ..... that although i am so in love with this color i would be embarrassed to wear this top in public . it could have been fantastic if the lace was softer and some a"
__label__0 "i coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram . i finally bought it in coral . it 's a beautiful coat the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down . the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me . i am 5 ' 5 and wear a size 8. i bought a medium worried a small would not button . the sleeves are far too long . i do not want to go through the trouble of returning so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller . it looks cute in her ."
__label__1 "i love wearing this . it is a little slice of summer which i am desperately hanging on to . the color pops it 's so very comfortable & the back is a work of art ! can be dressed up with a pencil summer skirt or down with capri style pants ."
__label__1 "this was a winner retailer ! ! ! ! ! bought it with my birthday discount . a bit pricey but when i wore it ( over and over again ) i can see why . the material is so soft flows beautifully and is just the right length on me . i am petite ( 5 ' 3 ) slender at 115 and i wear it with wedge heels just like the model . i did iron it when i took it out of the package but have not had to iron it again . i have received many compliments on this dress . bought the washed denim look . thank you ! ! ! !"
__label__1 "i love the dress overall however found it a tad snug in the bust area . overall a beautiful dress to own ."
__label__0 "as another reviewer mentioned maeve really needs to get their sizing under control and more consistent . i ordered a 4 and while it fits i think a 6 would be more comfortable in the arms and shoulders ( and i 'm a thin build ) . the length on this was also a little weird to me ... a little swingy/flared but also short making me feel like i 'd always be playing with it while wearing . the orange print is absolutely adorable i just wish the cut were more similar to past buttondowns that maeve has don"
__label__0 "i am a petite size 10 and 5 & # 39 ; 1 & quot ; i love the fabric and style of the dress but found it to be too much dress for me . the skirt is very full and with the top i feel it would look better on a thin taller person ."
__label__1 "love the coral color - so pretty in person . it is slightly lower cut on the chest than i expected . this is a great top for the weekends !"
__label__1 "i tried this top on with a pair of white shorts half tucked and it looked really classy and nice . the fit was loose but flattering it is a tiny bit sheer but i was wearing a magenta bra so perhaps i am biased . overall i think this is a good basic addition to a summer wardrobe can be worn with a nice skirt or with jeans as shown here . the 0 ( or xs ca n't remember ) fit me at 115 lbs with 30dd chest ."

__label__-1 "i ordered these because of the side zipper but they zip in front even though the order listing and bag label called them wine side zip pants . they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material . what bothers me is that i was charged $ 5.95 to send them back even though the product description ( and the name before someone changed it on the website ) were wrong ."
__label__-1 "i do n't normally write reviews but i purchased this dress in white in 3 different sizes and each dress had the same flaw . the hems were very uneven on all three . this dress was poorly sewn . it 's a shame because it looked awesome online . i was very disappointed ! ! ! ! !"
__label__-1 "i ordered this because the reviews were outstanding . i am returning it . although the embroidery looks fine on screen in person it looks cheap and tacky . moreover the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy . overpriced to boot . obviously mine is a minority opinion ."
__label__1 "these pants are great . i am 5 ' 6 and 133lbs . i normally wear medium for athletic bottoms . medium fits well except knee pit area . maybe because they are not very stretching fabric . however they are still flattering . the material was thick enough and their print hides underwear lines ."
__label__0 "the top falls nicely great quality the lace is beautiful . however the sleeves are too wide and puffy . the top is voluminous and i wished it had more form fitting sleeves to balance this out . the top does not look flattering on me so i will be returning it ."

__label__0 "the fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute however the drape on the front crossover is not great and does n't flatter well . the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i 'm very short ( 5 ' ) and the length is great for me but i 'm guessing not for the average height ."
__label__0 "this is a cute dress but just not a keeper for me . the top portion of the dress is fairly snug . i am normally a small in retailer sizes but i would have sized up the keep the dress from pulling so much across the bust . otherwise it was cute and simple and the tulle was quite soft . i think that i would have gone with a medium but i am wearing a small in the photo . for reference i am 5 ' 5 ~135 lbs 34c and 27 waist ."
__label__1 "soft knit perfectly finished comfortable and looks great on the model and the previous reviewers ' mom . it just looks too 'empty-nester ' for my style ( and i wo n't be until 2035 ! ) this is a nice base for a creative dresser/accessorizer which i 'm not . i 'm also messy so it 's hard to keep ivory clothing coffee free . i 'm glad i tried it on because it proves how great a label knitted & knotted is for quality garments . just had to pass on this for personal style reasons ."
__label__0 "i normally wear regular s but even the xsp is too wide on me . it is really maternity wear . also since the material is thin the ivory is too shear for my liking ."
__label__0 "love the style weight ( not too hot ) and look but it sheds all over any pants other than jeans . i also wore a white tank under it and it stained it blue . very disappointed"
__label__-1 "i 'm 50 and weigh 105 lbs . i purchased the xxs and it was super-wide and big all over . it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model . also not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long . this would work better on a taller person . i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big . the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace-up in the back is cute ."

__label__1 "love love love this top . it 's got a little bit of a native american vibe without being over-the-top . i tend to wear a small in retailer but the medium was the way to go for me . it 's not long and the style errs on the not-tight side . if you can go between two sizes do n't get the smaller one . and i love the shade of yellow !"

__label__0 "i really like the dress the material the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun . however the neckline is a bit to low and a cami is necessary at least for me . the material is very sheer which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short ( about 4 inches above the knee ) .the main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off . there are no zippers or buttons . getting it on is easy not so when taking it off !"

__label__0 "i tried this on in the store and the colors and fabric are terrific . it 's very light-weight fabric but is n't see-through . the colors are medium in depth not too bright . if you typically wear cool colors and avoid browns you may be able to wear this because the brown is very muted . there 's two strings inside that you tie around your waist to pull the bust of the dress in . i 'm 5 ' 4 and 125 lbs so there 's simply too much fabric in the dress . i would have bought a petite . the tag says it 's avai"

__label__-1 "i ordered the top from a store to have it shipped . it is very pretty but once on it fit the wrong way . i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust . the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line . sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless . the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high ."
__label__0 "soft cozy and cute but pilled badly after 1st wearing and now will be relegated to wearing at home only . for this reason i can not recommend . felt like i wasted my money . i purchased the xs petite ( i 'm 5 ' 1 . 95 lbs ) and i could have gone down to xxs but i was ok with it being looser ."
__label__1 "i was looking for a white shirt to layer with this winter . this shirt looks great on its own but it has also done great as a long sleeved layer under vests etc . it 's a little thin so i only gave it 4 stars for quality but it is holding up well so far ."

__label__-1 "cute in theory i love the bright colors the tied black collar sash and the 70 's vibe however the fabric is cheap and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern . maybe this was intentional but with the shirt i received it looked horrible . i sent it back . i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam so it is a bit deceiving . i would n't buy this top at any price based on"
__label__0 "this vest is very nice and fashionable very stylish . i like it a lot . however it is too itchy . the opening in the front did n't allow me to close as many buttons as i like but i would totally wear this stylish vest even though it is not as functional when it is cold . however the itchiness is too much . i do n't wear wool unless it is ultra soft or mixed with cashmere so i could not imaging wearing this vest it is too itchy . why ruin such a good thing ?"

__label__-1 "i just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up . i might exchange for bigger size as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back ."

__label__0 "i loved the look of this top when i saw it online however when i received it i was kinda disappointed . the color of the top was different than what i perceived initially . .it 's way more off white . .. not my favorite . the texture/pattern of fabric on the body of the top was too near hanky for me . the sequin detail at neckline is wonderful but not enough for me to keep . unfortunately i will be returning this one . not a hit for my desired as the tic but some one else might love !"
__label__-1 "this is another item i 've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available . i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i did n't even try it on because i knew it would be going back . the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric . the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim . so much potential just executed poorly ."
__label__0 "i love the style of this dress but unfortunately it runs very small . i normally wear a size 8. i ordered a 10 and the dress was closer to a size 6. disappointed that i had to return it . also the seams were poorly done and threads hung out everywhere on the hem ."
__label__-1 "it 's short and wide . not a good combo for anyone who is n't stick thin ."
__label__0 "this is a cute top that has a nicer texture and sheen to the velvet in person than the pictures do justice to ... it 's just simply richer and prettier in person . there 's a nice drape to the fabric but it 's cut pretty short and wide which is n't flattering imo unless you are very petite and have a small bust . i say this as someone who is small enough that i usually welcome a shorter cut top because most normal length tanks and tops are tunic length on me . i would have given it a higher star rat"
__label__0 "but-the problem is i can not get the color to stay below the shoulders . the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that did n't lay right . if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me . i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves but i ca n't get the desired look to work out so this is going back ."
__label__1 "i love this tank ! its something you can dress up with a skirt or wear over jeans . i like loose fitting tops although i have a slender frame . this is also so comfortable . i went with a size medium and it fits perfect ."
__label__-1 "from the photos i thought the design was embroidered . in reality it is stamped on . there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins but overall the design is just printed on the fabric . i did n't feel it looked good in fact it looked kind of cheap to me so i returned it . the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual . i was disappointed it did n't work out ."
__label__0 "i love the look and feel of this easy dress . i loved that it comes with a baby blue slip however i was in between sizes . the medium - a bit too small and the large- just too big . this dress is probably best in a tall thin body type especially in a madras plaid ."
__label__-1 "this coat is beautiful in color and design . we could have been great friends but it was waaay too big so i had to return it . i bought the smallest size possible yet i could have been 9 months pregnant and still would have had room to spare . i also was disappointed that the sleeves were not lined like other coats in this price range ."

__label__0 "this is a nice tunic but i wish it was a bit more structured . the band in the back helps hold it together so it does n't balloon out but a few more pin tucks would have been nice . i do like the length and style as a alternate to a white button down shirt and it looks super cute with skinny crop pants ."
__label__-1 "i 'm not sure if the top i received was damaged or if the design did n't consider gravity but this is not what i expected . i really want to like this top but i do n't see how i can wear it ."

__label__0 "i bought this because i thought it would flatter my boxy big busted shape and it does . however while i liked the irregular hemline on the model on my 5 ' 5 frame it hits at a strange place and so i will hem it a little shorter . the fabric is extremely thin and not lined so this is definitely a light weight summer top even here in the south . i love the modern styling but the quality of the fabric is a concern definitely no dryer on this one ."
__label__1 "i ordered an xxs and it fit perfectly . i love the simple yet girly look of this top . the bottom material is delicate and adds a feminine touch . it looks even better in person than in the pictures . the material is very soft and comfortable . looks great with jeans and flats or boots !"

__label__-1 "according to the label this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned . i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered . it looks like there 's a drawstring running through every seam . so disappointed in the quality and the labeling . awful ! i gave it one extra star because it 's cute ."
__label__0 "this shirt has a vibrant color and beautiful neck line but unfortunately i had to send it back . it is short waisted with a lot of material in the back . had it been 1-2 inches longer it may flare out but based on the length on me it ended up looking like a shrunken tent . for reference i am 5 ' 8 with a long torso ."

__label__-1 "the material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful ! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area . it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward ."

__label__0 "i am 5 ' 10 135 lbs normally a size 4l and ordered both a small in the navy and a medium in the beige . the elastic waist on both is not a tight/ muffin-top producing elastic like on some thinner banded leggings . in fact the elastic is very loose not very stretchy on either of the sizes . i think the s had been previously tried on given the state of the packaging and the fact that the seat of the pant was already a bit stretched out . the m is definitely too large so i would say that these run"
__label__0 "as with other maeve dresses the fit is great . i love the empire waist with stud details . the slip is nice and stretchy and i really like the flowy chiffon look over a fitted slip . i 'm not too keen on the way the sleeves tie and find that the ties get in the way of everything . when i first saw this online i was super excited to find it in the stores because i loved the big orange snake that is on the back of the dress shown online . however only the smallest size had the great snake on the back"
__label__1 "i love this skirt wanted to order it from the moment it was new and took em a while to decide to do so ( when i saw it was almost sold out in my size which it is now ) . another thing is it does n't come in petite - boohoo . anyway ordered the 0 ( smallest size ) for my 26.5 in waist - did n't have any trouble with the waist being too tight like some other reviewers . it fit really well and comfortably . sits at the natural waist so the hem is n't too crazy low on me . fine for heels ( would be so cute"
__label__1 "i loved this top so much i bought it in both colors . i have not seen anyone complain about this but on me the mock neck collapses in and looks messy . unfortunately i returned both . i sew and i do not understand why this happened ."
__label__0 "this dress is pretty and is somewhat fitted in the bodice . it does have an a-line fit in the skirt . the stitching is beautiful . honestly the stitching was a little too bright for me . some may like that but i was hoping for a little more toned down or muted . the colors are so vibrant in my opinion it almost cheapens the dress . the fabric is cotton and it is not lined . i am 5 ' 9 and it does hit right about where it does on the model . i am sending it back because i did n't say wow i love this w"
__label__0 "i fell in love with this romper and it was my go-to for any given day but as soon it got wet the blue dye bled everywhere so i had to return it ."
__label__-1 "i purchased this jacket in my local store . size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality . i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling . looks like it is worn in an bad way . returned the next day . this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad ."
__label__1 "byron lars knows how to make you look like a woman with his magical dresses ! i decided to get the navy ( i also own the sold-out marguerite aka carissima in bronze ) instead of the black or white since everyone and their mother owns it already . the lace of the top is different -- more delicate but less intricate . it 's still very beautiful . my body type is inverted and the dress is hourglass so the size 8p fits great on top but loose on my hips and rear . i 'm going to keep this dress and do mo"
__label__1 "i love that his blazer is soft and not so structured . so great for a business casual environment . the gray goes with everything and is already a staple in my wardrobe ."
__label__0 "the way the back came down so much made the top look weird . i do like some tops that hang longer in the back but this one was just too much . also the material was kind of blah it was thick polyester which would not be very cool during the summer and the color looked better in the picture . so to me it was just a over priced odd top ."
__label__0 "it 's just ok. very thin and feel like it might say and stretch . color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted ."
__label__-1 "this looked like a simple chic blouse but the fabric felt cheap to me like thin lining fabric . the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering ."
__label__1 "looks great with jeans for a more bohemian look . i normally wear a medium but went large to accommodate a 6 month pregnant belly . the blouse is loose enough i probably could have stayed with the medium ."
__label__1 "great dress that is very flattering . works well with flats or can be dressed up with heels . perfect for travel because the material does n't wrinkle . would highly recommend this dress !"
__label__1 "i am wearing a medium in the photos my measurements are 38-30-40 for reference ."
__label__-1 "as soon as you get up close to this sweater you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of material-almost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high . i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day . the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all . it was n't for me at all even thou"
__label__0 "i am torn about this dress . the print is very pretty and the fabric has a gentle flow to it . the top part is great but the portion below the chest reminded me of a tent . it is tricky to pull off if you are well-endowed on the top or wear a padded bra . i liked the look better when i tied it at the back with the ultra-thin belt straps which gave some shape to the waist . i agree with the other reviewer that a slim person could carry the look well . i usually do n't return online purchases unless they"
__label__1 "saw this tunic on line and loved the color combo . tried it on at the store and found it to be true to size for me - i 'm a 34 dd 5 ft 4 and the regular size 10 fit fine . i was curious to see if the petite size would fit best with the loops for the tie belt being a little higher but none were available . still the regular 10 works well . excited to wear when the weather gets warmer like the model with white skinny or cropped jeans and wearing it open as a duster with a tank or cami . seems very ve"
__label__1 "i just received this jacket in the cream color . it is so cute ! you can change it from 3/4 to full length sleeves . i ordered both an xs and s and kept the s after i saw that i could cinch the waist to fit better . in the picture it looks a bit boxier than it really is possibly because not cinched . the material is good quality and the jacket is complete with attention to detail from the buttons to the jean contrast pull on the zipper . i love this jacket ! it is a good cross over from athletic to cas"
__label__0 "i tried on the grey version in store and it was significantly longer than pictured . the back came down to just below my knee which looked awkward with the split sides . i am 5 ' 4 and this was a regular ( not petite ) size . however the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable ."
